            My name is Senna Faber, and I am a 19-year-old Business IT & Management student at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. My passion for
            IT began about three years ago, when I watched a YouTube video of a Japanese software engineer sharing his daily life. Even 
            though I had no prior coding experience, I was fascinated and decided to pursue a career in software development. I started in
            the Software Developer program at Talland College in Zaandam but later switched to the System Administration track, which I 
            completed in just two years instead of the usual three. During this time, I gained a solid foundation in networking, Windows 
            administration, and other IT fundamentals.My internship at AFS Group in Amsterdam provided valuable technical and soft skills,
            but it also showed me that I was interested in more than just IT. I developed a strong interest in project management, which 
            led me to my current studies in Business IT & Management, where I am combining technical knowledge with organizational and 
            management skills.
